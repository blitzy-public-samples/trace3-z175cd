# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Substack Replica platform is a comprehensive content management and monetization system designed to empower writers and content creators to build sustainable businesses through subscription-based newsletters. The platform addresses the growing need for direct creator-to-audience relationships by providing robust publishing tools, subscription management, and automated email delivery capabilities.

Key stakeholders include professional writers, independent journalists, subject matter experts, and their subscribers, with an expected business impact of democratizing content monetization while maintaining industry-standard platform fees of 10%. The system will enable content creators to focus on writing while the platform handles technical infrastructure, payment processing, and content delivery.
