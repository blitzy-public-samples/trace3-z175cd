# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policies, practices, and guidelines for the Substack Replica platform. We take security seriously and implement multiple layers of protection to ensure the safety of our users' data and system resources.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing security@substackreplica.com. We will respond within 48 hours.

Please include the following in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested remediation steps

We appreciate your help in keeping our platform secure and will acknowledge your contribution once the vulnerability is verified and fixed.

## Authentication and Authorization

The platform implements a robust authentication and authorization system using OAuth2 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

- **Token-Based Authentication**: JWTs are signed using HMAC SHA-256 and include role-based claims
- **Token Security**:
  - Tokens are encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
  - Token expiration is strictly enforced
  - Token validation includes signature verification and role checking
- **Session Management**:
  - Secure session handling with Redis-based storage
  - Automatic session invalidation on logout
  - Protection against session fixation attacks

## Data Encryption

We employ industry-standard encryption practices to protect data both at rest and in transit:

### Data at Rest
- All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256
- Secure key management following industry best practices
- Regular key rotation policies
- Encrypted database backups

### Data in Transit
- All communications secured using TLS 1.3
- Strong cipher suites enforced
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled
- Regular SSL/TLS certificate rotation

## Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of system resources, we implement rate limiting across our API endpoints:

- Default limit: 1000 requests per hour per user
- Rate limits are enforced at the middleware level
- Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- Graceful handling of rate limit exceeded scenarios
- Clear rate limit headers in API responses

## Role-Based Access Control

Access to resources is strictly controlled through a role-based access control (RBAC) system:

### User Roles
- Admin: Full system access
- Writer: Content creation and management capabilities
- Subscriber: Basic access to content and features
- Guest: Limited public access

### Access Control Implementation
- Role validation at middleware level
- Granular permission checking
- Hierarchical role structure
- Audit logging of access attempts

## Error Handling and Logging

Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms are in place to monitor and respond to security events:

### Error Handling
- Standardized error codes and responses
- Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Centralized error handling middleware
- Custom error types for security-related issues

### Security Logging
- Centralized logging system
- Structured log format with standardized fields
- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Log retention policies
- Real-time security event monitoring

## Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented across all responses:

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Regular Security Assessments

We maintain a robust security posture through:

- Regular penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Dependency security audits
- Code security reviews
- Security awareness training

## Compliance

Our security practices align with industry standards and regulations:

- OWASP Security Guidelines
- GDPR Compliance
- CCPA Compliance
- Regular security audits
- Data protection impact assessments
