# Kubernetes Version: 1.26.x
# Purpose: Define Ingress resources for managing external access to services within the cluster
# Requirements Addressed:
# - External Access Management (Technical Specification/System Architecture/Deployment Architecture):
#   Ingress resources manage external access to services within the Kubernetes cluster,
#   enabling routing based on hostnames and paths.

# Human Tasks:
# 1. Configure DNS records to point to the Ingress controller's external IP/hostname
# 2. Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured and renewed
# 3. Set up monitoring for Ingress traffic and response times
# 4. Configure appropriate security headers and CORS policies
